# Save-Machine-learning-Model-using-Pickle
This codes shows how to save a machine learning model using pickle and load it in future. 

A basic model is trained using random forest model and saved in a file using pickle library.

This model is also trained using other machine learning models here : [Drugs Classification using Multiple Models](https://github.com/saadbinmunir/Drugs-Classification-using-Multiple-models)
